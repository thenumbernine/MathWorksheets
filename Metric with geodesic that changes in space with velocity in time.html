Geodesic: $\dot{u}^a + {\Gamma^a}_{bc} u^b u^c = 0 $<br>
Connection coefficients: ${\Gamma^a}_{bc}$<br>
Spatial components of geodesic: ${\Gamma^i}_{ab}$<br>
So Tada, let ${\Gamma^i}_{tt} = -\frac{1}{(u^t)^2} \cdot \left[\matrix{
	cos( u^t ) \\
	sin( u^t ) \\
	0
}\right]$<br>
From this we get $\dot{u}^i = \left[\matrix{
	cos(u^t) \\
	sin(u^t) \\
	0
}\right]$<br>
Then as $u^t$ changes, the direction of $\dot{u}^i$ changes.<br>
You will accelerate in a different direction through space depending on how fast you are traveling through time.<br>
Except that $u^t = \dot{x}^t$ is not a variable that relates to the information at that point on the surface, while $x^t$ is.<br>
