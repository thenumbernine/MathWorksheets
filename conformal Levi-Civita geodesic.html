If you have a spatial / positive-signature metric associated with a coordinate basis, and you know the Levi-Civita connection to the metric,
and you have an associated conformal metric with determinant 1 that is computed by rescaling the coordinate metric, then what is the geodesic of the conformal metric?<br>
What is the Levi-Civita connection associated with the conformal metric?<br>
If it is ia Levi-Civita connection then it is torsion-free, and if it is non-coordinate then it must have commutation.<br>
But if it has commutation then it must have asymmetry or it must have torsion... Therefore it must have asymmetry.<br>
The conformal metric is calculated by rescaling, and the associated Levi-Civita connection is symmetric.<br>
However the Levi-Civita connection of the conformal metric would not be symmetric, and therefore could not be a rescaling of the Levi-Civita connection of the origianl metric.<br>
Doesn't BSSN formalism call the 'conformal connection' a rescaling of Levi-Civita connection?  Wouldn't this be incorrect?<br>
<br>

Here I'm assuming the signature of the metric is positive.<br>

<br>
$g_{ab} = e_a \cdot e_b = \partial_a \cdot \partial_b$ for a coordinate metric<br>
$g = det[g_{ab}]$<br>
$\bar{g}_{ab} = \phi g_{ab}$ such that $det[\bar{g}_{ab}] = 1$<br>
Therefore $det[\phi g_{ab}] = \phi^n det[g_{ab}] = \phi^n g = 1$,<br>
for $\phi = g^{-\frac{1}{n}}$ for dimension $n$<br>	
<br>

The Levi-Civita connection for a basis is:<br>
${\Gamma^a}_{bc} = \frac{1}{2} g^{ad} (e_c (g_{db}) + e_b(g_{dc}) - e_d(g_{bc}) + {c^d}_{bc} + {c^d}_{cb} - {c_{cb}}^d)$<br>
For a coordinate basis this is:<br>
${\Gamma^a}_{bc} = \frac{1}{2} g^{ad} (\partial_c (g_{db}) + \partial_b(g_{dc}) - \partial_d(g_{bc}))$<br>
<br>

There is freedom in choosing $\bar{e}_a$ such that $\bar{g}_{ab} = \bar{e}_a \cdot \bar{e}_b$,<br>
however so long as $g \ne 1$ we will have $\bar{e}_a \ne \partial_a$, and we have a non-coordinate basis.<br>
Therefore we have non-zero commutation for the Levi-Civita connection associated with $\bar{e}_a$ and $\bar{g}_{ab}$.<br>
<br>

Let $\bar{e}_a = {\bar{e}_a}^I \partial_I$ be the linear combination of coordinate basis that the basis of the conformal metric is represented as.<br>
Then $\bar{g}_{ab} = \bar{e}_a \cdot \bar{e}_b = {\bar{e}_a}^I {\bar{e}_b}^J \partial_I \cdot \partial_J = {\bar{e}_a}^I {\bar{e}_b}^J g_{IJ}$<br>
Hmm, notice I'm using these as sum terms, when I should be representing all this as operators.<br>
Then $1 = \bar{g} = det[\bar{g}_{ab}] = det[ {\bar{e}_a}^I g_{IJ} {\bar{e}_b}^J ] = det[ {\bar{e}_a}^I ]^2 \cdot det[g_{IJ}]$<br>
Let $\bar{e} = det[ {\bar{e}_a}^I ]$<br>
Then $1 = \bar{g} = \bar{e}^2 \cdot g$<br>
Then $\bar{e} = g^{-\frac{1}{2}}$<br>
So ${\bar{e}_a}^I$ can be any linear transformation such that $det[{\bar{e}_a}^I] = det[g_{ab}]^{-\frac{1}{2}}$<br>
<br>

Now our commutation fits the general form for commutations of linear combinations of coordinate basis:<br>
${c_{ab}}^c = 2 \bar{e}_{[a} ({\bar{e}_{b]}}^I) {\bar{e}^c}_I$<br>
...for ${\bar{e}^a}_I {\bar{e}_b}^I = \delta^a_b$ and ${\bar{e}^a}_I {\bar{e}_b}^J = \delta_I^J$, i.e. $[{\bar{e}^a}_I]$ is the linear inverse of $[{\bar{e}_a}^I]$.<br>
<br>

This has the geodesic (taken from my 'metric-cancelling and torsion-free connection' worksheet):<br>
${\bar{\Gamma}^a}_{bc} = {\Gamma^a}_{bc} + {\bar{e}^a}_I \partial_b ({\bar{e}_c}^I)$<br>	
<br>
<br>

For one conformal rescaling connection in particular: ${\bar{e}_a}^I = \delta_a^I g^{-\frac{1}{2n}}$.<br>
Then ${\bar{e}^a}_I = \delta^a_I g^{\frac{1}{2n}}$.<br>
Then $det[{\bar{e}_a}^I] = g^{-\frac{1}{2}}$, which fulfills our requirement for the conformal rescaling to have a determinant of 1.<br>
$\partial_b {\bar{e}_c}^I = \partial_b g^{-\frac{1}{2n}} \delta_c^I$<br>
$= -\frac{1}{2n} g^{-1-\frac{1}{2n}} \cdot g g^{uv} \partial_b g_{uv} \delta_c^I$<br>
$= -\frac{1}{2n} g^{-\frac{1}{2n}} g^{uv} \partial_b g_{uv} \delta_c^I$<br>
<br>

${\bar{e}^a}_I \partial_b ({\bar{e}_c}^I) = \delta^a_I g^{\frac{1}{2n}} \cdot -\frac{1}{2n} g^{-\frac{1}{2n}} g^{uv} \partial_b g_{uv} \delta_c^I$<br>
$ = -\frac{1}{2n} \delta^a_c g^{uv} \partial_b g_{uv}$<br>
<br>

The Levi-Civita connection becomes:<br>
${\bar{\Gamma}^a}_{bc} = {\Gamma^a}_{bc} + {\bar{e}^a}_I \partial_b ({\bar{e}_c}^I)$<br>	
$= {\Gamma^a}_{bc} - \frac{1}{2n} \delta^a_c g^{uv} \partial_b g_{uv}$<br>
<br>

By definition of the Levi-Civita connection we know that the connection is symmetric in its 2nd and 3rd indexes.<br>
Here's a question: If we have a symmetric connection, does that ensure that there exists a coordinate basis?<br>
I'll venture to say yes.  If we have a Levi-Civita connection associated with a coordinate system then we can pick any one coordinate and reparameterize it by scaling the parameter with the conformal factor and we will have a new coordinate system.<br>
