<h2>Network Description:</h2>

Network topology:<br>
$l = $ number of layers.<br>
$n_k = $ input size of the k'th layer.<br>
$m_k = $ output size of the k'th layer.<br>
$\sigma_k = $ k'th layer activation function.<br>
<br>

Network state, independent of any signal:<br>
$w_{k, i, j}(t) = $ k'th layer linear relation between i'th output and j'th input, at iteration "t"
	for $1 \le k \le l$, 
	$1 \le i \le m_l$,
	$1 \le j \le n_l$.
	<br>
For networks with using bias, $1 \le j \le n_l+1$.<br>
Yes I am conflating iteration and time.  I don't care about time-dependent input data or state-based recurrent-networks right now.<br>
$w_{k, i, j}(0) =$ initial weight value at iteration t=0. Weights are initialized randomly.<br>
<br>

Network feed-forward live variables:<br>
Inputs are provided from some external environment.<br>
$x_{k, j}(t) =$ k'th layer j'th input, at iteration "t"
	for $1 \le k \le l$ and $1 \le j \le n_l$.<br>
For networks using bias, $1 \le j \le n_l + 1$, with $x_{k, n_l + 1}$ always assigned to 1.
	<br>
$\xi_{k, i}(t) = \underset{j=1}{\overset{n_l+1}\Sigma} \left( w_{k, i, j}(t) \cdot x_{k, j}(t) \right) = $ k'th layer i'th output.<br>
$y_{k, i}(t) = \sigma_k ( \xi_{k, i}(t) ) = \sigma_k ( \Sigma_j w_{k, i, j}(t) \cdot x_{k, j}(t) ) = $ k'th layer output.<br>
$x_j(t) = x_{1, j}(t) =$ first layer j'th input = network j'th input.<br>
$x_{k, j}(t) = y_{k-1, i}(t) =$ k'th layer j'th input = (k-1)'th layer j'th output.<br>
$y_j(t) = y_{l, j}(t) = $ network output.<br>
<br>

Network training variables:<br>
$d_j(t) = $ desired output (for trained data) for iteration "t".<br>
$e_{l,j}(t) = d_j(t) - y_j(t) =$ residual of the output (with gradient towards the desired)<br>
$E(t) = \frac{1}{2} \Sigma_j (e_{l,j}(t))^2 =$ network energy function to minimize.<br>
The one-half out front is to cancel the derivative of the square term, so the gradient becomes proportional to the residual vector.<br>
<br>

There's the desired, and residual functions.<br>
I might drop the "t" parameters and declare the dependency to be implicit, just like in physics.<br>
<br>

Back-propagation update:<br>
Update weights to minimize error:<br>
$\frac{\partial w_{k,i,j}}{\partial t} = -\frac{\partial E}{\partial w_{k,i,j}}$<br>
Gradient of the final layer weights:<br>
$\frac{\partial E}{\partial w_{l,i,j}} 
	= \frac{\partial E}{\partial e_{l,i}} 
		\frac{\partial e_{l,i}}{\partial y_{l,a}} 
		\frac{\partial y_{l,a}}{\partial \xi_{l,b}} 
		\frac{\partial \xi_{l,b}}{\partial x_{l,j}}
$<br>
$\frac{\partial E}{\partial e_{l,i}} 
	= \frac{\partial}{\partial e_{l,i}} \left( \frac{1}{2} \Sigma_j (e_{l,j})^2 \right)
	= \Sigma_j \left( e_{l,j} \cdot \frac{\partial e_{l,j}}{\partial e_{l,i}} \right)
	= \Sigma_j \left( e_{l,j} \cdot \delta_{ij} \right)
	= e_{l,i}
$<br>
$\frac{\partial e_{l,i}}{\partial y_{l,a}}
	= \frac{\partial}{\partial y_{l,a}} \left( d_i - y_{l,i} \right)
	= -\delta_{ia}
$<br>
Gradient calculations of variables that are valid for each layer:<br>
$\frac{\partial y_{k,a}}{\partial \xi_{k,b}} 
	= \frac{\partial}{\partial \xi_{k,b}} \left( \sigma_k ( \xi_{k,a} ) \right)
	= \sigma_k' ( \xi_{k,a} ) \frac{\partial \xi_{k,a}}{\partial \xi_{k,b}} 
	= \sigma_k' ( \xi_{k,a} ) \cdot \delta_{ab}
$<br>
$\frac{\partial \xi_{k,b}}{\partial x_{k,j}}
	= \frac{\partial }{\partial x_{k,j}} \left( w_{k, b, c} \cdot x_{k, c} \right)
	= w_{k, b, c} \cdot \frac{\partial x_{k, c}}{\partial x_{k,j}}
	= w_{k, b, c} \cdot \delta_{cj}
	= w_{k, b, j}
$<br>
Substitute our computed terms:<br>
$\frac{\partial E}{\partial w_{l,i,j}} 
	= e_{l,i}
		\cdot -\delta_{ia}
		\cdot \sigma_l' (\xi_{l,b} ) \delta_{ab}
		\cdot w_{l, b, j}
	= -(d_i - y_{l,i}) \sigma_l' ( \xi_{l,i} ) w_{l, i, j}
$<br>
$\frac{\partial w_{k,i,j}}{\partial t} = (d_i - y_{l,i}) \sigma_l' ( \xi_{l,i} ) w_{l, i, j}$<br>
Gradient of previous layers weights:<br>
$\frac{\partial E}{\partial w_{k,i,j}} 
	= \frac{\partial E}{\partial y_{k,i}} 
		\frac{\partial y_{k,i}}{\partial \xi_{k,a}} 
		\frac{\partial \xi_{k,a}}{\partial x_{k,j}}
$<br>
<br>

A neural-network weight matrix is just a linear transform.  The output test is typically looking at whether the output is greater than some value.  
So assuming the activation is near-linear (which it tends to be for some domain),
we are really looking at a collection of hyperplanes that are forming a convex hull in our output space around whatever we want to classify.<br>
<br>

<h2>Example: Logical-NOT</h2>

Let's look at a single-neuron with-bias trained to the logical-NOT problem.<br>
We are going to classify True = 1 and False = -1, and therefore our desired problem to reproduce is $y(x) = -x$.  Our output classification will be $y \gt 0$ for True, otherwise False.<br>
Topology: <br>
$l = 1$, $n = \{ 1 \}$, $m = \{ 1 \}$<br>
$\sigma_1(x) = x = $ identity for activation function.<br>
State: <br>
$w = w_{1, 1, 1} = $ weight that corresponds with our single input.<br>
No bias is needed and no bias will be used.<br>
Live variables:<br>
$x = x_1 = x_{1, 1} = $ our network input, which will be +1 for 'True' and -1 for 'False'.
Notice that if you were to plot our x vs y, we are trying to reproduce the logical-NOT function $y(x) = -x$.<br>
This means we won't need any extra linear terms.  We don't need a bias term for our weight matrix. 
If I picked 'False' to be 0 then our output function of the input would be $y(x) = 1 - x$, which requires a bias value, and I would need to simulate a bias weight.<br>
$\xi_{1, 1} = w x = $ the linear transform of our inputs, aka "net-accumulated sum of the neuron".<br>
$y = y_1 = y_{1,1} = \sigma_1 ( \xi_{1,1} ) = \xi_{1,1} = w x = $ the network output.<br>
Training variables:<br>
$d = d_1 = $ our desired value, which will be $-x$.  So if our input is 1 for True then our desired output will be -1 for False, and vice-versa.<br>
$e = d - y = (-x) - w x = (-1 - w) x$<br>
$E = \frac{1}{2} e^2 = \frac{1}{2} ((-1 - w) x )^2$<br>
Weight updates:<br>
$\frac{\partial w}{\partial t} = -\frac{\partial E}{\partial w} = -(1 + w) x^2 $<br>
<br>

Fixed points are where $\frac{\partial w}{\partial t} = 0$.  This is true for...<br>
$0 = (1 + w) x^2 $<br>
...which is true for $x = 0$, or for $w = -1$<br>
So those are our dynamic system 2 fixed points.<br>
We don't have to worry about the $x = 0$, since our inputs are either +1 or -1.<br>
So we have fixed points at $w = -1$<br>
Of course $w = -1$ is our desired answer, since we are trying to reproduce the behavior of the equation $y(x) = -x$, i.e. $y(x) = w x$ for $w = -1$.<br>
Let's assume an Euler integration:<br>
$w(t + \Delta t) = w(t) + \Delta t \cdot \frac{\partial w(t)}{\partial t}$<br>
$w(t + \Delta t) = w(t) - \Delta t \cdot \frac{\partial E(t)}{\partial w(t)}$<br>
$w(t + \Delta t) = w(t) - \Delta t \cdot (1 + w(t)) x(t)^2 = -\Delta t \cdot x(t)^2 + (1 - \Delta t \cdot x(t)^2) w(t)$<br>
<br>

Dynamics classification says, for some sequence $x_n$:<br>
$|\frac{\partial x_{n+1}}{\partial x_n}| \gt 1$ is a source, i.e. the system will diverge from this fixed point.<br>
$|\frac{\partial x_{n+1}}{\partial x_n}| = 1$ is indeterminant.  Or does this mean it will neither converge nor diverge? I forget...<br> 
$|\frac{\partial x_{n+1}}{\partial x_n}| \lt 1$ is a sink, i.e. the system will converge to this fixed point.<br>
$|\frac{\partial x_{n+1}}{\partial x_n}| = 0$ is a super-critical sink, i.e. the system is stationary at this point.<br>
<br>

$|\frac{\partial w(t + \Delta t)}{\partial w(t)}| = |1 - \Delta t \cdot x(t)^2|$<br>
<br>

In either case our fixed point convergence is independent of our dynamic variable, the weight, and only dependent on the input magnitude.<br>
If we provide $x(t) = 0$ as an input then our $|\frac{\partial w(t + \Delta t)}{\partial w(t)}| = 1$, which means we have indeterminant behavior neither converging nor diverging.<br>
Now the fixed points are specific to the update, which is specific to our desired training value, which is defined as $\pm x$ for inputs $x \in \{ -1, 1 \}$, so good thing $x = 0$ isn't a valid 'True' or 'False' input.<br>
<br>

For what values is the system converging?<br>
$|\frac{\partial w(t + \Delta t)}{\partial w(t)}| = |1 - \Delta t \cdot x(t)^2| \lt 1$<br>
$-1 \lt \Delta t \cdot x(t)^2 - 1 \lt 1$<br>
$0 \lt \Delta t \cdot x(t)^2 \lt 2$<br>
... assuming $\Delta t \gt 0$:<br>
$0 \lt x(t)^2 \lt \frac{2}{\Delta t}$<br>
This is true for $x \in (-\sqrt{\frac{2}{\Delta t}}, 0) \bigcup (0, \sqrt{\frac{2}{\Delta t}})$<br>
If we use $x \in (-\sqrt{\frac{2}{\Delta t}}, 0) \bigcup (0, \sqrt{\frac{2}{\Delta t}})$ then we will converge.<br>
For $x \gt 0$ values we will diverge.<br>
Since our inputs are $x = \pm 1$, this tells us that we can only use a timestep:<br>
$1 \lt \frac{2}{\Delta t}$<br>
$\Delta t \lt 2$<br>
<br>

TODO repeat the process with non-identity $\sigma$, like tanh.<br>
Then using tanh activation with T/F set to $\{-1,1\}$ vs $\{\frac{-9}{10}, \frac{9}{10}\}$<br>
Then repeat the process with T/F set to {0,1}.<br>
Then using a sigmoid activation with T/F set to $\{0,1\}$ vs $\{\frac{1}{10}, \frac{9}{10}\}$ ... and with bias weight (two weight system now) since the classification needs to now fit to $y(x) = 1 - x$ instead of $y(x) = x$<br>
<br>

<h2>Example: Logical-AND</h2>

We are going to classify True = 1 and False = -1, $y \gt 0$ for true, $y \le 0$ for false.<br>
Therefore our desired problem to reproduce is something along the lines of:<br>
$y(x_1, x_2) = \frac{1}{2} x_1 + \frac{1}{2} x_2 - \frac{1}{2}$, such that $y(-1,-1) = -\frac{3}{2} = F, y(-1,1) = -\frac{1}{2} = F, y(1,-1) = -\frac{1}{2} = F, y(1,1) = \frac{1}{2} = T$ .<br>
Topology:<br>
$l = 1, n = \{2\}, m = \{1\}$<br>
$\sigma(x) = \sigma_1(x) = x =$ identity activation.<br>
State:<br>
$w_1 = w_{1,1,1}, w_2 = w_{1,1,2}, w_3 = w_{1,1,3}$ are our weights, (with $w_3$ being the bias input weight).<br>
Live variables:<br>
$x_1 = x_{1,1}; x_2 = x_{1,2}$ are our inputs.<br>
$\xi_1 = w_1 x_1 + w_2 x_2 + w_3$<br>
$y = \sigma(\xi_1) = w_1 x_1 + w_2 x_2 + w_3$<br>
Training variables:<br>
We can do more exact with our description of our desired value as a function of our inputs, by multiplying our inputs, 
however neural networks themselves are planes are linear transformations and cannot directly reproduce multiplication.<br>
$d(x_1, x_2) = 2 \left( \frac{1}{2}(x_1 + 1) \cdot \frac{1}{2} (x_2 + 1) \right) - 1 = \frac{1}{2} (x_1 x_2 + x_1 + x_2 - 1)$.<br>
This is chosen such that $d(-1,-1) = d(-1,1) = d(1,-1) = -1 =$ False, and $d(1,1) =$ True.<br>
<br>

$e = d - y = \frac{1}{2} (x_1 x_2 + x_1 + x_2 - 1) - \left( w_1 x_1 + w_2 x_2 + w_3 \right)$<br>
$e = \frac{1}{2} x_1 x_2 + \frac{1}{2} x_1 + \frac{1}{2} x_2 - \frac{1}{2} - w_1 x_1 - w_2 x_2 - w_3$<br>
$E = \frac{1}{2} e^2 
	= \frac{1}{2} \left(
		\frac{1}{2} x_1 x_2 + \frac{1}{2} x_1 + \frac{1}{2} x_2 - \frac{1}{2} - w_1 x_1 - w_2 x_2 - w_3
	\right)^2$<br>
$\frac{\partial E}{\partial w_i} = e \cdot \frac{\partial e}{\partial w_i}
	= e \cdot \frac{\partial e}{\partial w_i}
	= e \cdot -\frac{\partial y}{\partial w_i}
	= -e x_i$<br>
$\frac{\partial w_i(t)}{\partial t} = -\frac{\partial E}{\partial w_i} = e x_i$<br>
$w_i(t + \Delta t) = w_i(t) + \Delta t (d - y) x_i$<br>
$w_i(t + \Delta t) = w_i(t) + \Delta t (\frac{1}{2} (x_1 x_2 + x_1 + x_2 - 1) - (w_1 x_1 + w_2 x_2 + w_3)) x_i$<br>
<br>

Fixed points:<br>
$\frac{\partial w_i(t)}{\partial t} = 0$ for $x_i e = 0$.
One solution is $x_i = 0$.
Another is $e = 0$, i.e. for $w_1 x_1 + w_2 x_2 + w_3 - \frac{1}{2} (x_1 x_2 + x_1 + x_2 - 1) = 0$<br>
This looks like a plane equation in $\{w_1, w_2, w_3\}$ space.<br>
For our inputs this can be the possible values:<br>
$x_1 = -1, x_2 = -1: -w_1 - w_2 + w_3 + 1 = 0$<br>
$x_1 =  1, x_2 = -1:  w_1 - w_2 + w_3 + 1 = 0$<br>
$x_1 = -1, x_2 =  1: -w_1 + w_2 + w_3 + 1 = 0$<br>
$x_1 =  1, x_2 =  1:  w_1 + w_2 + w_3 - 1 = 0$<br>
So for each possible set of inputs, our neural network state critical point will be a different plane.<br> 
<br>

Dynamics:<br>
$|\frac{\partial w_i(t + \Delta t)}{\partial w_i(t)}| = |1 - \Delta t (x_i)^2|$ for $x_3 = 1$<br>
$|\frac{\partial w_1(t + \Delta t)}{\partial w_1(t)}| = |1 - \Delta t (x_1)^2|$<br>
$|\frac{\partial w_2(t + \Delta t)}{\partial w_2(t)}| = |1 - \Delta t (x_2)^2|$<br>
$|\frac{\partial w_3(t + \Delta t)}{\partial w_3(t)}| = |1 - \Delta t|$<br>
So as long as our inputs are $x_i = \pm 1$, and our timestep $\Delta t = 1$, our fixed point is super-critical.<br>
<br>

So we are going to be always instantly converging on a solution per-input/desired pair, but that solution will vary over all possible pairs.<br>
<br>

What if we look at the critical point of the system after iterating across all possible permutations of inputs/desired? I.e. equivalent to a "batch update" of all 4 possible inputs.<br>
$w_i(t + \Delta t) = w_i(t) + \Delta t \frac{1}{4} ($<br>$
\ 	  (\frac{1}{2} (x_1 x_2 + x_1 + x_2 - 1) - (w_1 x_1 + w_2 x_2 + w_3)) x_i | (x_1 = -1, x_2 = -1)$<br>$
	+ (\frac{1}{2} (x_1 x_2 + x_1 + x_2 - 1) - (w_1 x_1 + w_2 x_2 + w_3)) x_i | (x_1 = 1, x_2 = -1)$<br>$
	+ (\frac{1}{2} (x_1 x_2 + x_1 + x_2 - 1) - (w_1 x_1 + w_2 x_2 + w_3)) x_i | (x_1 = -1, x_2 = 1)$<br>$
	+ (\frac{1}{2} (x_1 x_2 + x_1 + x_2 - 1) - (w_1 x_1 + w_2 x_2 + w_3)) x_i | (x_1 = 1, x_2 = 1)$<br>$
)$<br>
<br>
Individually:<br>
<br>
$\frac{\partial w_1(t)}{\partial t} = \frac{1}{4} \left(
	- (-1 + w_1 + w_2 - w_3)
	+ (-1 - w_1 + w_2 - w_3)
	- (-1 + w_1 - w_2 - w_3)
	+ ( 1 - w_1 - w_2 - w_3)
\right) = -w_1(t) + \frac{1}{2}$<br>
$w_1(t + \Delta t) = w_1(t) \cdot (1 - \Delta t) + \frac{1}{2} \Delta t$<br>

<br>
$\frac{\partial w_2(t)}{\partial t} = \frac{1}{4} \left(
	- (-1 + w_1 + w_2 - w_3)
	- (-1 - w_1 + w_2 - w_3)
	+ (-1 + w_1 - w_2 - w_3)
	+ ( 1 - w_1 - w_2 - w_3)
\right) = -w_2(t) + \frac{1}{2}$<br>
$w_2(t + \Delta t) = w_2(t) \cdot (1 - \Delta t) + \frac{1}{2} \Delta t$<br>
<br>

$\frac{\partial w_3(t)}{\partial t} = \frac{1}{4} \left(
	  (-1 + w_1 + w_2 - w_3)
	+ (-1 - w_1 + w_2 - w_3)
	+ (-1 + w_1 - w_2 - w_3)
	+ ( 1 - w_1 - w_2 - w_3)
\right) = -w_3(t) - \frac{1}{2}$<br>
$w_3(t + \Delta t) = w_3(t) \cdot (1 - \Delta t) - \frac{1}{2} \Delta t$<br>
<br>

Our fixed point of $\frac{\partial w_i(t)}{\partial t} = 0$ shows up for $w_1 = \frac{1}{2}, w_2 = \frac{1}{2}, w_3 = -\frac{1}{2}$.<br>
With these weights, our neural network reproduces the eqution:<br>
$y(x_1, x_2) = w_1 x_1 + w_2 x_2 + w_3 = \frac{1}{2} x_1 + \frac{1}{2} x_2 - \frac{1}{2}$<br>
... just like we were looking for.<br>
<br>

In each case:<br>
$|\frac{\partial w(t+\Delta t)}{\partial w(t)}| = |1 - \Delta t|$<br>
... which will converge for $\Delta t \in (0,2)$, and is super-critical for $\Delta t = 1$.<br>
<br>

TODO next do classification of OR problem, AND problem with 1-layer.<br>
then do XOR problem, and show it cannot be done with 1-layer and needs 2-layers.<br>
