Rivers at the equator are more twisty than those further North or South.<br>
Trees at the equator are more twisty than those further North or South.<br>
The spacetime further N or S of the equator is twisting more than at the equator.<br>
Maybe in nature there's a certain amount of 'twist' required.<br>
And in the N and S, twisting comes from spacetime.<br>
But in the equator twisting has to be accomodated for in the structure of plants and rivers.<br>
so how much does the spacetime twist ...<br>
<br>

That's the question of - what's the geodesic acceleration of geodesic pointing around the rotation axis ... for coordinates the $\theta$ polar angle, $\phi$ the angle around ...<br>
We use the geodesic equation $\dot{u}^i = -{\Gamma^i}_{jk} u^j u^k$ <br>
And the anholonomic-normalized, spherical-surface connections:<br>
${\Gamma^\theta}_{\phi\phi} = -\frac{1}{r} cot(\theta) = -{\Gamma^\phi}_{\phi\theta}$.<br>
<br>

So our equation of its acceleration, expanded, is<br>
$\dot{u}^i = -{\Gamma^i}_{\theta\theta} u^\theta u^\theta - {\Gamma^i}_{\theta\phi} u^\theta u^\phi - {\Gamma^i}_{\phi\theta} u^\phi u^\theta - {\Gamma^i}_{\phi\phi} u^\phi u^\phi$<br>
So our vector us pointing around the circle... with no up/down component ...  so it has $u^\theta = 0, u^\phi = 1$ ...<br>
So plug in and this simplifies to $\dot{u}^i = -{\Gamma^i}_{\phi\phi} u^\phi u^\phi$.<br>
so $\dot{u}^\theta = -{\Gamma^\theta}_{\phi\phi} = \frac{1}{r} cot(\theta)$ (the amount it is pulled N/S by the geodesic).<br>
And $\dot{u}^\phi = -{\Gamma^\phi}_{\phi\phi} = 0$ (the amount it is pulled E/W by the geodesic).<br>
So the twisting up/down is by $\frac{1}{r} cot(\theta)$ for $\theta$ the polar angle ... 0 = north pole, 90' = equator, 180 = south pole.<br>

Likewise the parallel-propagation of a vector along the equator is given by...<br>
${P^i}_j (\phi_L, \phi_R) = exp(-\int_{\phi_L}^{\phi_R} {\Gamma^i}_{\phi j})$<br>
<br>
${P^i}_j (\phi_L, \phi_R) = exp \left[ \begin{matrix}
	0 & \frac{\Delta \phi}{r} cot(\theta) \\
	-\frac{\Delta \phi}{r} cot(\theta) & 0
\end{matrix} \right]$<br>
<br>
${P^i}_j (\phi_L, \phi_R) = \left[ \begin{matrix}
	cos \left( -\frac{\Delta \phi}{r} cot(\theta) \right) &
	sin \left( -\frac{\Delta \phi}{r} cot(\theta) \right)
	\\
	sin \left( -\frac{\Delta \phi}{r} cot(\theta) \right) &
	cos \left( -\frac{\Delta \phi}{r} cot(\theta) \right)
\end{matrix} \right]$<br>
